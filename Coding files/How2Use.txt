Encoding

Step 1: Put the text in "Source.txt" file
Step 2: Run "hideIt.py" (requires python 3.4)
Step 3: Type "hideText" in the prompt then input the key (u should know it phew)
Step 4: Get the ciphered text in "Result.txt"

Reverse for decoding (cmd = "showText")

WARNING: The "Result.txt" must be empty before running the code,
or it will mix two texts in the same file.
